I found that as soon as I log into my computer that I usally lanuch the broswer and go to the same general websites each morning. These being news, email, stocks, and social media. 

Download both app.py and favorite-websites.txt and put them in a location you can referance later. 

Change and edit the favorite-websites.txt to what your are.
